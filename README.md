# FilterBubble
A simple automated webscrypt that sets up a left or right wing oriented filter bubble. Well at least in theory...

For this code to work, you will need a chromium driver that works with the version of chrome you have installed, so check in your chrome settings what version you are running, thendownload the appropriate driver and replace the one in this repository. The driver I have included works with chrome version 89.
